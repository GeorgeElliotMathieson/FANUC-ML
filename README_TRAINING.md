# FANUC Robot Training - Unified Approach

This document describes the consolidated training approach for the FANUC robot positioning task. We've made significant improvements to the training process to ensure better results and a more maintainable codebase.

## Key Improvements

1. **Consolidated Implementation**: Merged multiple training implementations into a single, unified approach.
2. **Simplified Reward Function**: Designed a more stable reward function with fewer hand-tuned components.
3. **Standardized Model Architecture**: Implemented a simpler, more efficient neural network architecture.
4. **Improved Memory Management**: Added explicit garbage collection and optimized tensor operations.
5. **AMD GPU Exclusive**: Optimized exclusively for AMD GPUs through DirectML with specific optimizations for RX 6700S.
6. **Consistent Joint Limit Handling**: Standardized on the JointLimitedBox action space.
7. **Better Evaluation Metrics**: Enhanced monitoring and evaluation of training progress.
8. **Unified Command-Line Interface**: Created a wrapper script (`train_robot.py`) for easier usage.

## Usage

The main entry point for training is now `train_robot.py`, which provides a unified interface for all training-related tasks:

```bash
# Start training from scratch (AMD GPU acceleration is always used)
python train_robot.py --steps 1000000

# Continue training from a saved model
python train_robot.py --load ./models/directml_20230815_123456/final_model --steps 500000

# Evaluate a trained model
python train_robot.py --eval-only --load ./models/directml_20230815_123456/final_model --eval-episodes 20

# Run a demonstration with a trained model
python train_robot.py --demo --load ./models/directml_20230815_123456/final_model --viz-speed 0.05
```

### DirectML Models

All models use DirectML format, which is optimized for AMD GPUs. The system automatically detects and loads models with the appropriate settings.

If you encounter issues with model compatibility, make sure to:
1. Verify the model was saved with the correct extension (usually `.pt`)
2. Ensure that the DirectML package is properly installed (`pip install torch-directml`)
3. Check that you're using a compatible AMD GPU

## AMD GPU Acceleration (Required)

The implementation requires AMD GPU acceleration through DirectML, specifically optimized for the RX 6700S GPU. 

### Installation

1. Install the necessary DirectML package:
   ```bash
   pip install torch-directml
   ```

2. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   python -c "import torch_directml; print(f'DirectML device: {torch_directml.device()}')"
   ```

3. Check for available GPUs (you should see your AMD GPU listed):
   ```bash
   python -c "import torch_directml; print(f'Available devices: {torch_directml.device_count()}')" 
   ```

### DirectML Workflow

All training, evaluation, and demonstration use DirectML acceleration:

1. **Training**:
   ```bash
   python train_robot.py --steps 50000
   ```

2. **Evaluating Models**:
   ```bash
   python train_robot.py --eval-only --load ./models/directml_TIMESTAMP/final_model.pt
   ```

3. **Demonstrating Models**:
   ```bash
   python train_robot.py --demo --load ./models/directml_TIMESTAMP/final_model.pt
   ```

### Successfully Tested Configurations

The following configurations have been tested and confirmed working:

| Task | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Training | `python train_robot.py --steps 50000` | Creates a model in `./models/directml_TIMESTAMP/` |
| Training (cont.) | `python train_robot.py --steps 20000 --load ./models/directml_TIMESTAMP/final_model.pt` | Continues training from existing model |
| Evaluation | `python train_robot.py --eval-only --load ./models/directml_TIMESTAMP/final_model.pt` | Evaluates a model |
| Demo | `python train_robot.py --demo --load ./models/directml_TIMESTAMP/final_model.pt` | Demonstrates a model |

### Best Practices

1. **Keep consistent workflow** - train, evaluate, and demo all with the same implementation
2. **Manage resources** - For larger models, adjust batch size and number of parallel environments
3. **Save frequently** - Use a reasonable `--save-freq` value to prevent loss of progress

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems with models:

1. **Memory errors**: Reduce batch size or number of parallel environments
2. **Performance issues**: Check GPU utilization and adjust batch size
3. **Model loading errors**: Ensure the model path is correct and the file exists

## Architecture Details

### Unified Wrapper Script

The `train_robot.py` script serves as a wrapper around the core implementation in `res/rml/python/train_robot_rl_positioning_revamped.py`. It provides several important functions:

1. Sets up the correct Python path for module imports
2. Handles command-line arguments including the convenient `--demo` flag
3. Provides friendly error handling and a unified interface
4. Automatically configures DirectML for AMD GPU acceleration

### AMD GPU Acceleration

The implementation has been optimized to work with AMD GPUs through DirectML, with specific optimizations for the RX 6700S GPU:

1. **DirectML Configuration**: Sets up optimal performance parameters for AMD GPUs
2. **Batch Size Optimization**: Uses larger batch sizes with fewer epochs for better AMD GPU utilization
3. **Memory Management**: Implements efficient memory usage patterns for AMD GPUs
4. **Operation Optimization**: Reduces overhead from small operations that are less efficient on AMD GPUs

### Reward Function

The reward function has been simplified to focus on three key components:

1. **Distance Component**: Exponential reward based on distance to target
2. **Progress Component**: Reward for making progress toward the target
3. **Action Penalty**: Small penalty for unnecessary movements

This creates a smoother gradient for the agent to follow while reducing conflicting objectives.

### Neural Network Architecture

The feature extractor uses a simpler architecture with three fully-connected layers and layer normalization:

```
Input -> Linear(512) -> LayerNorm -> ReLU ->
      -> Linear(512) -> LayerNorm -> ReLU ->
      -> Linear(256) -> LayerNorm -> ReLU -> Output
```

This architecture provides a good balance between expressivity and efficiency.

### Joint Limit Handling

We standardized on the `JointLimitedBox` action space, which inherently enforces joint limits by mapping normalized actions (-1 to 1) to the corresponding joint limits. This approach is more robust and prevents actions that would exceed the physical limits of the robot.

## Files

- `train_robot.py`: Main entry point for all training tasks
- `res/rml/python/train_robot_rl_positioning_revamped.py`: Core implementation of the training algorithm
- `train_robot_rl_ppo_directml.py`: DirectML-optimized implementation for AMD GPUs
- `res/rml/python/robot_sim.py`: Robot simulation environment
- `directml_train.py`: Dedicated script for DirectML training
- `directml_demo.py`: Dedicated script for demonstrating DirectML models

## Monitoring and Evaluation

During training, the following metrics are tracked and plotted:

- Average reward
- Success rate
- Average distance to target
- Average episode length
- Joint limit violations

These metrics are saved as plots in the `./plots` directory and can be used to monitor training progress.

## Model Saving

Models are saved at regular intervals during training to the `./models` directory, with each training run creating a timestamped subdirectory. The final model is saved as `final_model` in this directory, along with the normalization statistics used during training.

## Demonstration Mode

The `--demo` flag provides a convenient way to demonstrate a trained model. When this flag is used:

1. The trained model is loaded
2. The visualization speed is set to a slower pace for better observation
3. Multiple evaluation episodes are run to showcase the model's capabilities

This mode is perfect for presentations or for quickly testing a model's performance.

- `--episodes`: Number of episodes to run (default: 2)
- `--no-gui`: Run in headless mode without visualization

### Windows Batch Files

For ease of use, we've created two Windows batch files:

1. **show_directml.bat** - Quick visual demonstration of a model
   ```batch
   # Default usage (ppo_directml_20250326_202801 model, 3 episodes)
   show_directml.bat
   
   # With parameters: model_folder, episodes, viz_speed
   show_directml.bat ppo_directml_20250326_202801 5 0.05
   ```

2. **directml_summary.bat** - Detailed performance evaluation
   ```batch
   # Default usage (10 episodes, no GUI)
   directml_summary.bat
   
   # With parameters: model_folder, episodes
   directml_summary.bat ppo_directml_20250326_202801 20
   ```

### Example

```bash
# Run a demonstration with 5 episodes and slower visualization
python directml_show.py ./models/ppo_directml_20250326_202801/final_model --episodes 5 --viz-speed 0.05

# Generate a comprehensive performance report with 20 episodes
python directml_show.py ./models/ppo_directml_20250326_202801/final_model --episodes 20 --no-gui
```

This specialized script provides better compatibility with DirectML models and more detailed insights into model performance compared to the generic runners.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal use of AMD GPUs with DirectML:

1. **Batch Size**: Use larger batch sizes (256-1024) for better performance
2. **Parallel Environments**: Use 16-32 parallel environments for training
3. **Memory Management**: DirectML may use more memory, so monitor usage
4. **Reduced Precision**: DirectML uses FP32 by default, but can benefit from reduced precision

## Hyperparameters

Optimized hyperparameters for AMD GPUs:

1. **Batch Size**: 256-1024
2. **Training Epochs**: 4
3. **Memory Management**: More aggressive memory management
