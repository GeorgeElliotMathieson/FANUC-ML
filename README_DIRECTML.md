# DirectML Enhancements for FANUC Robot Evaluation

This document provides details on the enhancements made to the FANUC robot evaluation system to better support DirectML-trained models.

## Overview of Improvements

We've enhanced the system with the following features:

1. **Refined Model Structure**: The `CustomDirectMLModel` class has been updated to better match the exact dimensions in saved DirectML models through:
   - Automatic dimension adaptation that infers model architecture from parameters
   - Improved parameter loading with appropriate shape checking
   - Better handling of different model architectures

2. **Generic Parameter Loading Mechanism**: The system now adapts to different model architectures through:
   - Flexible parameter mapping with fallbacks for different naming conventions
   - Architecture inference directly from the state dictionary
   - Support for models with different layer sizes and structures

3. **Enhanced Visualizations**: Added comprehensive visualization capabilities specific to DirectML models:
   - Episode-by-episode visualization of rewards, distances, and actions
   - Observation heatmaps to understand model behavior
   - Summary statistics and visualization across episodes
   - Success rate and performance metrics

4. **Streamlined Evaluation Tools**: We've added specialized tools for evaluating DirectML models:
   - Isolated evaluation script that avoids argument parsing conflicts
   - Windows batch file for easy evaluation with flexible options
   - Comprehensive visualization generation

## Key Components

### 1. CustomDirectMLModel Class

The `CustomDirectMLModel` class now features:

- Automatic architecture inference from model state dictionaries
- Support for tuple and dictionary observations
- Enhanced parameter mapping system
- Robust error handling for shape mismatches

### 2. Evaluation Workflow

The evaluation process has been improved with:

- New `evaluate_model_wrapper` function to simplify model loading and evaluation
- Support for both DirectML and standard models in the same evaluation pipeline
- Better error handling and logging throughout the process
- Enhanced rendering capabilities with fallbacks

### 3. Visualization System

The visualization system now generates:

- Episode-specific visualizations for actions, rewards, and distances
- Observation heatmaps to understand what the model "sees"
- Summary statistics across episodes with success metrics
- Markdown documentation of evaluation results

## Usage Guide

### Running Standard Evaluations

To evaluate a model using the standard approach:

```bash
python train_robot.py --eval-only --load ./models/ppo_directml_20250326_202801/final_model --eval-episodes 5 --gui
```

### Using the Dedicated Evaluation Tool

For DirectML models, we've created a specialized evaluation script that avoids argument parsing conflicts:

```bash
python run_eval.py ./models/ppo_directml_20250326_202801/final_model 5 --verbose
```

Where:
- First argument: Path to the model file
- Second argument (optional): Number of episodes to evaluate (default: 5)
- Options:
  - `--verbose`: Show detailed output
  - `--no-gui`: Disable visualization
  - `--speed=X`: Set visualization speed in seconds (default: 0.02)

### Using the Windows Batch File

On Windows, you can use the provided batch file for even easier evaluation:

```bash
evaluate_directml.bat [model_path] [episodes] [options]
```

Examples:
```bash
evaluate_directml.bat  # Uses default model and settings
evaluate_directml.bat ./models/ppo_directml_20250326_202801/final_model 3  # 3 episodes
evaluate_directml.bat ./models/my_model 5 "--no-gui --verbose"  # Headless mode with verbose output
```

### Generating Visualizations

Visualizations are automatically generated in the `visualizations/directml_TIMESTAMP` directory when evaluating DirectML models.

### Interpreting Results

The evaluation generates several key metrics:

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of episodes where the robot successfully reached the target
- **Average Distance**: Mean distance to target across all episodes
- **Average Reward**: Mean total reward across all episodes
- **Best Distance**: Closest approach to the target across all episodes

## Implementation Notes

### Model Detection

DirectML models are automatically detected by checking for "directml" in the model path. This triggers the appropriate handling for AMD GPU acceleration.

### Dimension Matching

The system now handles dimension mismatches gracefully by:

1. Inferring the expected architecture from the state dictionary
2. Identifying parameters that can be loaded directly
3. Warning about parameters with shape mismatches
4. Providing defaults for missing parameters

### Error Handling

Enhanced error handling includes:

- Comprehensive try-except blocks throughout the codebase
- Detailed error logs with traceback information
- Graceful fallbacks to CPU when DirectML is unavailable

### Argument Parsing Conflicts

Our specialized evaluation script uses techniques to avoid argument parsing conflicts:

1. The `run_eval.py` script temporarily modifies `sys.argv` before importing modules
2. Arguments are manually parsed to avoid conflicts with imported modules
3. Isolated imports to minimize dependencies on the main training code

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. Support for more DirectML-specific optimizations
2. Additional visualization types for deeper analysis
3. Interactive visualization dashboard
4. Support for more complex model architectures

## Known Issues

Current known limitations:

1. Some parameters may not load correctly if the model architecture differs significantly
2. Visualizations may be limited for very high-dimensional observation spaces
